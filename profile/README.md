# Prevent Apophis from colliding with Earth


## Introduction

<!-- Motivation -->
Asteroid 99942 **Apophis** on April 13th, 2029 will pass less than 20,000 miles (32,000 kilometers) from our planet’s surface [1], it is a potentially hazardous asteroid [2].

Although the propability of Apophis collision with Earth is low, the severity is high, therefore a plan to prevent the collition is required.

<!-- Why builidng this organization -->
Governments and space institutions have their own agendas, that's why an open and collaborative organization is required to research and develop the technology required to:
<!-- Problem to solve -->
- **prevent Apophis from colliding with Earth.**

<!-- Learning required -->
To prevent this collision all management and engineering tools are going to be required (Project management, Design for six sigma, I.T. Architecture, etc).

<!-- What makes your organization stand out? -->
This gives the opportunity to everyone that has knoledge in these areas to participate and collaborate to save the Earth.


## Mission

This organization has the mission to deflect Apophis asteroid before 2029-04-13 and prevent a collision with Earth.
